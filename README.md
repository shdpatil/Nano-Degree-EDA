Red Wine data set is used for analyzing and creating variables with R programming language
In this project,I used R language and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore 
relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.


I started by looking at the individual distributions of the variables, trying to investigate each seperately.
Out of the chemical varibles, the only one that stood out was the concentration of citric acid.
First thing i noticed was the high number of wines that had no citric acid at all. 
My initial thought was a data collection error, but upon researching the subject, I found that citric acid is sometimes
added to wines to boost overall acidity, so it makes sense that some wines would have none. Nonetheless this variable also showed 
a strange distribution with some peaks but showing an almost rectangular distribution specially in the 0-0.5 range. 


All of the other variables showed either an normal or long tailed looking distribution. Through this exploratory data analysis,
I had many challenges while analyzing the chemical composition of all the variables and how those are related, but I was able to
identify the key factors that determine and drive wine quality, mainly:<li> alcohol content</li> <li> sulphates</li> <li> acidity</li>
Most confusing ones were the pH and the acids, but then after researching some websites on the internet I started 
getting the ideas about the variables and I started creating my analysis on the quality which is base of my project. 
The most promissing varibles were alcohol concentration, sulphates and the individual acid concentrations. My biggest challenge
was to build the predictive model,for analysing the other factors which were affecting the pH other than the acids but with the help 
of example project and some websites, I was able to build it. It is important to note, however, that wine quality is 
ultimately a subjective measure. The graphs adequately illustrate the factors that make<li> good wines ‘good’</li> and<li> bad wines ‘bad’.</li>


Further study with inferential statistics could be done to quantitatively confirm these assertions.
